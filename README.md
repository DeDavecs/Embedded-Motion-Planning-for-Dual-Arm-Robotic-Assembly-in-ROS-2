# UR5e Development Branch

This branch was created for internal development and testing purposes during the early stages of the dual-arm motion planning project.

🚧 **Note:** This is **not** part of the main release of the repository.  
The official implementation can be found in the [`main`](https://github.com/DeDavecs/Embedded-Motion-Planning-for-Dual-Arm-Robotic-Assembly-in-ROS-2) branch.

## Purpose

The `ur5e` branch contains:
- Prototype configurations and motion planning scripts
- Testing setups for individual UR5e arms
- Early-stage debugging and workspace experiments

## Status

- ✅ Safe to explore for reference
- ❌ Not actively maintained
- 🚀 Superseded by the modular architecture in the main branch

## Recommendation

For the most up-to-date and complete version of the project, please refer to the `main` branch.
